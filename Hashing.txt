Hashing:

Searching: Time Complexity

When keys are large, and can't be directly used as index to store value, we can use technique of hashing.

Hash Table: Mostly it is an array to store values. It is the data structure.

Hash function: is any function that can be used to map values to the particular keys.

-easy to compute
-minimize collisions

Hash collision resolution:

-Two tyoes of collision resolution

1. Open hashing (chaining)
2. Closed Hashing (Open Addressing)

-Whether collisions are stored outside the table (Open hashing).
-Whether collisions result in storing one of the records at another slot in the (closed hashing).

Closed Hashing:

1. Linear Probing = i= i+1= i+1...
2. Quadratic probing = i+9, i+16...
3. Double hashing = i+6, i+8..
