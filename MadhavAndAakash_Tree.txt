Tree:

Tree non-linear data structure.

Tree heirarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

Height of a Node: number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf node.

Depth of a Node: Number of edges from the root to the node.

Height of a tree: Height of the root or the depth of the deepest node.

Degree of a Node: Total number of branches of that node.

Types of Tree:

1. Binary Tree
2. Binary Search Tree

Tree Traversal:

1. Inorder Traversal
2. Preorder Traversal
3. Postorder Traversal

-->Inorder Traversal:

1. First visit all the nodes in the left subtree.
2. Then the root node.
3. Visit all the nodes in the right subtree.

-->Preorder Traversal:

1. Visit Root node.
2. Visit all the nodes in the left subtree.
3. Visit all the nodes in the right subtree.

-->Postorder Traversal:

1. Visit all the nodes in the left subtree.
2. Visit all the nodes in the right subtree.
3. visit Root node.
