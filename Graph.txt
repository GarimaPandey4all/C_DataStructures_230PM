Graph:Non - linear data structure.

Graph is a common data structure that consists of a finite number of sets of nodes or vertices and set of edges connecting them.

A pair(x, y) is referred to as an edge, which commuicates that the x vertex connects to the y vertex.

Graphs real life examples: Networks, like social networks, telephone networks, circiut networks.

Types of Graphs:

1. Undirected:

In an undirected graph, nodes/vertices are connected by edges, that are all bidirectional. 

2. Diredted:

In a directed graph, nodes/vertices are connected by directed edges they only go in one direction.


Types of Graph Representations:

1. Adjacency list
2. Adjacency Matrix
